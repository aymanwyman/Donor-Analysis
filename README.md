## Data Quality Assessment  

Steps taken to prepare the dataset include:  
- Cleaning inconsistent naming conventions (e.g., 'USA' vs. 'United States of America').  
- Addressing minor spelling errors (e.g., 'Viet Nam' corrected to 'Vietnam').  
- Removing duplicate rows while preserving data integrity.
